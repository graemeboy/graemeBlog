<p>Gurus are defined not by their expertise, but rather by their followers.</p>

<p>A guru is looked to by his or her followers for guidance. For these followers, the guru is an exemplar - someone who can show them how achieve a specific goal. This task can be anything from internet marketing, to spiritual enlightenment. In all cases, the guru either consistently performs these tasks in a way that leads to good results, or at least appears to have done so in the past.</p>

<p>The follower's goal is to replicate these behaviors, and achieve a similar level of success. If the follower does replicate the guru's success, then the guru's status is diminished, and the follower can hypothetically become a guru. The slower the rate of the follower's success, the more secure is the status of the guru.</p>

<p>By watching the guru, the follower hopes to learn specific methods of  success. By being followed, the guru's success is validated to others, which often leads to an even greater following.</p>

<p>The guru status can be a fantastic source of a weath (and other perks, such as fame, or sex with followers) - as in the examples of Osho, or Baba Muktananda (who would sleep with teenage female devotees), or the case of marketers who only make money by teaching (but not testing) their marketing techniques.</p>

<p>Gurus don't need to have all of the answers. In fact, it is often advantageous if the guru has little to say on the actual matter. Spiritual gurus get away with this by arguing that their "truth" cannot be put into mere words, and therefore must "teach" by prescribing  practice (such as meditation, or tantric yoga). Marketers will often talk about their own examples of success, without delivering specific principles.</p>

<p>When dealing with the more seductive Gurus, we can keep in mind a quote by Christopher Hitchens in <em>Letters to a Young Contrarian</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Beware the irrational, however seductive...Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others...Picture all experts as if they were mammals...Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you."</p></blockquote>
