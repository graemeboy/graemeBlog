<p>You can hack the WholeFoods salad bar for profit - you just have to choose the offerings that are worth more than $8.95 per pound. That's partly how I survived as a tourist living in the Bay Area on $50 a day during the summer of 2010. I was 20 years old.</p>

<p>As an international student, I couldn't work for money, but I could do computer science homework for Stanford students who wanted to party, in exchange for crashing in their dorm rooms. That's another reason I made it out, all the while working on my JoinMe.to startup - a way for students to meet one another for a specific activity. This startup idea has since been robbed from me, but that's okay; there are plenty of ideas out there.</p>

<p>There was a month before school started at Stanford, and I still had to house and feed myself. In one of the best business deals of my life, I secured a neat little room in a house in Berkeley for $20 a day. Once I had moved into the room that was actually on offer through Airbnb for $80 a day, I noticed a smaller empty room that wasn't on offer, and I was able to stay in that room instead for a reduced price. It turns out some hosts set lower prices in person than they do online. Try it sometime.</p>

<p>I bought breakfast, lunch and dinner at WholeFoods, occassionally turning to Subway if I was hungry in the evening. You don't need as much food when you've got drive - ironically though, they call both of those states "hungry." While I was staying at that house in Berkeley, I created a small Wordpress plugin that I traded with a blogger for about $2,500. This was a lucky break that covered my humble living and travel expenses for the summer. Having grown up in South Africa, and gone to college in Mid-West America, it took me a while to realize how expensive it is to live in California!</p>

<p>I have since returned to live in California, in 2014 as a more financially capable adult. This time, taxes are on my mind, and rent is more of a problem. A friend recently asked me what I think about living here, and I immediately blurted out, "I think it's crazy to live in San Francisco. Taxes are high and rent is insane, so people only get out a small percent of their income to live on." And it's true; San Francisco living is suited for people making $100k a year minimum, and even then it seems like a poor investment. If you're doing so, you're unnecessarily trading at least $15k of that to state taxes and inflated rent. That $15k a year compounded for ten years at a 8% return is $217,298.44 - so that's the price of living here instead of, say, Palm Springs, Fort Lauderdale, Seattle, or Las Vegas.</p>
