    <p>A common problem in dynamic programming (DP) is creating a list
        of all the combinations of a given set of characters or numbers.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
            <thead>
                <th>Input</th>
                <th>Output</th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>hat</td>
                    <td>aht, ath, hat, hta, tah, tha</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>abc</td>
                    <td>aht, ath, hat, hta, tah, tha</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>123</td>
                    <td>123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The solution for this problem is usually recursive, and takes O(n!) time. Here is an implementation in JavaScript</p>
