<p>In neurology, "efferent" fibers are those that transmit impulses from higher-order systems, to lower-order "actuators," or muscle units. This fundamental physiological term "efferent" is a simple concatenation of the verb "to bear" with the proposition "away from," but incites my curiosity in what, precisely, is borne across it. Elementary neurology tells us that these fibers carry complex codes, time-varied patterns of intensities from connected networks of neurons. Further than this, psychology becomes vague – we do not pursue much into the meanings of these population codes. Action potentials, neural currents, we will certainly describe – but these are the forms of data, and not the representations themselves. This has been the stepping-off point of contemporary psychology. Through third-person observation, the perspective of the objective science that psychology strives to be, these representations are hidden, despite our privileged first-person access to them. Thus, outside of theoretical neuroscience, the proper home of Perceptual Control Theory, researchers will not go further than nominally describing the inner workings of our cognitive systems as information-processing "mediating variables." In the absence of such investigation, even the furthest-reaching psychological programs continuously adopt the dogmatic stimulus-response model, the legacy of Behaviorism (which denied perception), with the added level of mediating variables that account for cognitive interpretation. This model conveniently ignores facts of human perception, and its unsatisfying experimental results, based on support for hypotheses by statistical significance testing, have drawn loud complaints about psychology’s relation to its peer sciences. Perceptual Control Theory bravely contends these shortcomings, by proposing a purposive explanation for human behavior that is congenial with the principles of physics and engineering.</p>

<p>Perceptual control theory is a bottom-up theory of perception, and a top-down theory of control. To use David Marr’s influential meta-analysis of information processing theories (in which systems are described at one of three levels: computation, algorithmic, or implementation), PCT describes behavior at the algorithmic level. Powers has also attempted an implementation-level analysis, but admits that there are various plausible methods of implementation, and the correct method will become more apparent with further research. PCT’s algorithmic nature distinguishes it from other theories of behavior, in that PCT goes beyond merely relating input to output, and specifies how control operations are executed.</p>

<h3>The Perceptual Chain</h3>

<p>In PCT’s analysis of perception, sensations grow in complexity as they traverse through the nervous systems, from neuron to neuron, network to network. For example, on a low-level in the primate visual system, light is reflected onto the retina, which causes activity in the retinal ganglion cells. Each of these cells is activated by the appearance of light at a particular point in the retina. Thus, even though there is a somewhat homomorphic map of an object on the retina, the ganglion cell at this level activates purely from the intensity of light on a small area of the retina. When groups of nearby cells are all activated, the summation of their action potentials causes a higher-level cell, to which they are connected, to fire. This cell is effectively firing because there is a straight line of some orientation appearing on the retina. These cells are then line-orientation dependent, rather than position dependent, and will fire whenever there is a line of its preferred orientation anywhere on the retina. Thus, the system has grown in complexity and abstraction. This is the bottom-up hierarchical nature of PCT, which posits 9 levels of perception: intensity (the lowest level of processing), sensation or vector, configuration, transitions, sequence, relationship, program, principles, and system of concepts.</p>

<h3>The Control Chain</h3>

<p>PCT’s theory of control is top-down, involving a chain of sequences that, just the reverse of the perceptual chain, contains at each step an abstraction of previous sequences, and therefore make the previous sequences irrelevant for the next step of processing (much like a Markov chain.) The interaction of the two processes, perception and control, can be easily illustrated with an example: Organisms are driven by certain needs, such as that for food or water. When an organism, say this one, needs some water, I need to direct my behavior so as to seek out and ingest some. To move my hand towards my glass, I need to manipulate my body and the environment. According to the hierarchy of complexity described by PCT, as my hand approaches the glass, my premotor neurons will not respond to the position of the glass on my retina (this is important), but rather to the position of my hand and head relative to the glass. This is consistent with experimental data. As my hand gets nearer to the glass, my organism is closer to my goal of picking it up; at a high level, then, my check for progressing success is the position of my hand relative to the glass, as mapped by activity in my premotor cortex. Further down the stream of neural activity, the accuracy of this position is described by a relation of the position of my hand, sensed through my body’s proprioception, and the configuration of line orientations that forms the shapes and textures of the cup on my retina. Thus, there is a new goal for each step in the chain of control towards my muscles, based on references that descend from my motor cortex. For every external disturbance that occurs, the system counteracts to draw the perception towards a "reference," which represents an optimal state for that perception, given the higher purpose of the organism. In PCT, the signal traversing down the system is either an instantiated neural representation for the next level to refer to, or it is a memory link to a reference (there is still investigation to do on this point.) The sensation, which is meanwhile travelling up through the perceptual system, is compared to the reference signal via a comparator function, which subtracts the perceptual signal from the reference, and determines an error signal. The control task for this level will be to match the incoming signal to the reference, thereby reducing the error signal. The system achieves this by influencing the next step in the control chain, right down to the muscles.</p>

<p>Therefore, this approach describes behavioral control as the manipulation of sequential units in a descending system, by matching each unit’s perceptual signal to the reference signal that the system bears from higher-level systems. It is a complete and robust theory that can, if supported by future research, move psychology to a clearer and more useful science.</p>
