A person's political alignment, democratic or republican, reflects where he or she believes is the origin of suffering. Sound far-fetched? Allow me to explain before you dismiss me.

On a deep level, some people believe that they are responsible for the misfortunes of their own lives. If they stub their toe on a protruding feature in a public space, they'll say, "I should have seen that and avoided it." Others will see the protruding feature as a public problem. After all, even if they had avoided stubbing their toe, it's still a danger to others who might stub theirs! "Somebody ought to remove this feature," they say, "or design an effective prevention strategy." The difference between these two people is that the one takes personal responsibility for the event, while the other perceives, from a larger perspective, the responsibility of society to protect its members. (I once saw a homeless person in San Francisco step in a puddle of water, and scream to the heavens, "Why would you do this to me!" - But that's a different perspective altogether.)

The point is, that if you perceive your suffering as a societal problem, then you'll demand that society as a whole attempt to fix it. "Society must come together," you might say, "and fix this dangerously protruding feature." This requires public organization, and perhaps some way to tax individuals in order to pay for better construction of that space. You see where I'm going with this; it's a socialist's perspective.

On the other hand, if you see this as a personal problem, then your solution might be to stop visiting that space, or to create a new space that doesn't have such dangerous features. This, in essence, is capitalism. If you have the skill to create a safer space, then you might attract more customers. Problems are opportunities to you, because you can learn from them and create better solutions. To the socialist, this seems wasteful - after all, the space was almost perfect aside from this small bug, which we could have fixed quite easily. Capitalism creates excess and waste, a lengthy range of products that are more or less the same.

To the capitalist, the socialist's strategy of recruiting the public to solve the problem is also problematic. After all, how do we decide what to fix? The socialist's solution to this is often (but not always) to put it to public vote, and hence the socialist perspective often becomes a democratic alignment. But, if we put it to a democratic vote, the capitalist argues, then experts don't have a privileged say. If we leave it to the market rather, then the best solutions will naturally become the public's default. Moreover, one person's problem is sometimes another person's delight; variety is one of the strength's the the capitalist's solution.


So, if it is true that political alignment such as this depends on where we see the source of suffering - in ourselves, or in our social environment - then how would our admired figures of the past cast their votes?

The Buddha, it would seem, is clearly republican.
