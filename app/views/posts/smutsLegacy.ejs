<blockquote><p>In 500 years of the College's history, of all its members, past and present, three had been truly outstanding: John Milton, Charles Darwin and Jan Smuts.</p><footer>Lord Todd, the Master of Christ's College, Cambridge University, 1970.</footer></blockquote>

<div class="col-sm-7" style="padding-left:0"><p>When Jan Smuts' son found out that the international airport at Johannesburg was to lose its name, then called Jan Smuts International, he made a call to airport officials to find out what they intended to do with the large iron bust of his father, which had resided in a proud place in the airport. He was concerned that the bust would be removed once the aiport took on its new name, after Oliver Thambo. An official said that the bust had already been taken down, and that it would soon be on its way to the scrapyard.</p></div>

<p>This event reflects the legacy of Field Marshal Jan Smuts in the country of his birth and death. It is glossed over in the history syllabi, and I believe this is for good reason - for to whose history does Jan Smuts belong? Born as an Afrikaaner, and Commander in the Anglo-boer war, one might think his legacy draws strong allegience from the Afrikaans population in South Africa. But years of propaganda by the Afrikaans nationalists during his reign as prime minister have scorched the loyalty he had earned in that war. Smuts was also held responsible for the execution of Jopie Fourie, the rebel who, unresigned from his commission, was captured in full South African uniform. Because he was captured in uniform, Fourie's punishment was death - and this was unaimously agreed to in the courts. Fourie became a boer hero, and his execution became a murder by Smuts' hands that the Afrikaaners would never forgive.</p>

<p>Smuts was depicted by nationalists as an Anglophile who would betray South African interests to court favor from the British. The fact that, in 1907, he had given one of South Africa's prized possessions, the largest diamond ever found (the Cullinan Diamond), as a gift to King Edward VII, does little to counter this argument! Other facts, such as that Jan Smuts forged the mandates system, providing autonomy to all the dominion states of the British Empire (which lead to independence for all commonwealth nations from the British), is somewhat understudied.</p>

<h3>Smuts and the British Academy</h3>

<p>Smuts won a scholarship to read law at Cambridge University, where he was considered to be one of their greatest scholars. While a student, he sat both parts of the Law Tripos simulatenously, which had never been achieved, and finished with a double first - along with prizes in jurisprudence and Roman Law. The seeds of his philosophy, Holism, which would be published in 1927, were already planted. He had already written a biography on Walt Whitman. After his studies he returned to South Africa, where served as a commander in the Boer War.</p>

<h3>Launching the Commonwealth and League of Nations</h3>

<p>In a speech to the members of both Houses of Parliament in 1917, Smuts launched the concept and name of "the Britsh Commonwealth of Nations." It became a forerunner of the Statute of Westminister, and milestone in the political emancipation of the Dominions. Prime Minister Lloyd George requested that he joined the Imperial War Cabinet, which he accepted while refusing an additional salary. However, in what would become one of history's most regretful decisions, Smuts turned down Lloyd George's suggestion that he stand for Parliament. King George, favoring Smuts as a possible Prime Minister for England, made him Privy Councillor of the Companions of Honor. According to C P Scott, editor of the <em>Manchester Gaurdian</em>, during 1917 "Smuts was perhaps the most popular man in the country." Smuts detested and shied away from the popularity, a disposition that yielded grave consequences for Europe, in that it weakened his power to act on his prodigious foresight and wisdom.</p>


<blockquote><p>What a man! His sense of values takes one away from Paris and this greedy turmoil</p><footer>Harol Nicolson, at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.</footer></blockquote>

<p>In a speech that would begin the formation of the League of Nations (now the United Nations), Smuts, with his vision that had no bounds, argued that the end of the First World War would create "an atmosphere of hatred and ill-will and of international estrangement," insisting that Britain ought not to be "inspired by an vengeful feelings, by a desire to destroy the German nation." Essentially, Smuts realized that something like the Treaty of Versailles was in the minds of Allied leaders, and predicted that it would cause another World War, or the depression of Europe. President Wilson supported his idea for the League. Later, in 1918, Smuts wrote a paper called "The League of Nations: A Practical Suggestion," which would become the basis for its implementation.</p>

<h3>Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles</h3>

<blockquote><p>I have never read any State Paper...with anything like the agreement I feel in regard to this of yours. I feel quite confident that President Wilson will agree with you. His language is wholly in that spirit...This war, as terrible as it has been...will leave one compensation if your ideas are embodied in the ersults of the Peace Conference.</p><footer>Lord Loreburn to Smuts, 1918</footer></blockquote>

<p>Smuts was intensely involved in the Paris Peace Conference. However, Soon after the opening address by the "smug Poincare" in January, which Smuts referred to emphatically as "a poor beginning" ("Here is a world waiting for the World, for some crumb of comfort. And we had nothing to say excerpt punishment for war crimes...Whether the boundary is just here or just there...it leave me stone cold"), he regarded it as a farce.</p>

<p>Smuts labored for months to overturn the dreadful proceedings at the time, get European leaders to give Germany a reason to become allies, instead of reasons to become isolated, antagonistic, and vengeful. While Smuts was greatly respected by leaders such as Churchill, his words were not heeded. Looking back, one has to wonder whether Smuts could have prevented the Second World War from happening at all, if he had accepted higher political positions during his time of popularity and used that influence to steer the course of events.</p>

<h3>Smuts Remembered</h3>
<p>Smuts is remembered for his great optimism and energy, his philosophy of Holism, which is most popular today (and was said by Einstein to be one of the most important theories to appear alongside the theory of relativity.) He loved poetry, was a scholar of the classics, a brilliant statesmen, war hero, and phenomenal scientist. He was also a beloved husband, father, and grandfather. Most of all, though, he was a great human, retaining dignity and honor when the world was pulling itself apart and when leaders could think only of revenge and destruction.</p>
